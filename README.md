                                             This is a project which is done in the field of Cryptography .
                                             My project title is "BLOCKCHAIN BASED DATA TRADING ECO SYSTEM".
                                             The main concept of the paper is to secure the data set using the blockchain.
                                             The public repositories are used to collect the dataset in centralised manner where 
                                             attacker can easily compromise the data so we create a simulation of data trading with
                                             cryptocurrency(ether) in blockchain for secure transformation.
