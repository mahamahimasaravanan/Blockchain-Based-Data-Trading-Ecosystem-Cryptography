This is a project which is done in the field of Cryptography .
My project title is "BLOCKCHAIN BASED DATA TRADING ECO SYSTEM".
The main concept of the paper is to secure the data set using the blockchain.

In traditional data trading platforms, issues like dishonest behavior and hacking vulnerabilities exist. To address this, we've developed a blockchain-based data trading system where buyer and seller identities remain anonymous, ensuring trusted transactions. Blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature makes it resistant to hacking. Unlike centralized platforms vulnerable to single-point failures, our system decentralizes data exchange. Sellers upload datasets with descriptions, and our platform matches buyer requirements, preventing unauthorized resale or modification. This highlights the significance of data processing as a service, complementing traditional data hosting/exchange models.The public repositories are used to collect the dataset in centralised manner where 
attacker can easily compromise the data so we create a simulation of data trading with
cryptocurrency(ether) in blockchain for secure transformation.
